# Books and Authors Database Populator

This script populates a SQLite database with random authors and books using the `Faker` library. It generates 500 authors and 1000 books, ensuring that each book's publish date is at least 10 years after the author's birth date.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `Faker` library

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
Usage

pip install faker
python create_db.py
