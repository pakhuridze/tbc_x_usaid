# LibraryApp

This project is a Python application that generates a library of books and authors, stores them in an SQLite database, and allows you to run various SQL queries to analyze the data.

## Features

- 500 randomly generated authors (with names, birth dates, and cities).
- 1000 randomly generated books associated with the authors (with titles, categories, page counts, and publish dates).

### Database Queries

- Calculate the average number of pages across all books.
- Find the youngest author and calculate their age.
- List authors without any books.
- List authors who have written more than 3 books.
